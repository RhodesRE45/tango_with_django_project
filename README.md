# tango_with_django_project

# For the past days, I've been using the wrong Django book, so I'm starting late. But I'm familiar with the first few chapters. I'll speed things up and finish.

# The following is a repository for my error project: https://github.com/RhodesRE45/tango_with_django_project_wrong.git

# Because I have learned part of Template Inheritance and URL Template Tag in GIC(Glasgow International College). And began the assignment without reading the entire book. I used Chapter 8 of knowledge in advance.
